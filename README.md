# Static Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **Static Portfolio**!  
This project showcases my personal and academic work as a **web developer and designer**, built using only **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript** — and hosted with **GitHub Pages**.
The goal of this project is to create a professional online presence that highlights my projects, skills, and experience in web development.  
It serves as both a portfolio and a practice site for responsive design and GitHub hosting.
